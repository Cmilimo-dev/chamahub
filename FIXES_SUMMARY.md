# ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied - Console Errors Resolution

## âœ… Issues Fixed Successfully

### 1. **Multiple Realtime Subscription Error**
**Problem**: `tried to subscribe multiple times. 'subscribe' can only be called a single time per channel instance`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added subscription checks in `useGroupsSubscription.ts` and `useRealtimeContributions.ts`
- Implemented proper subscription registry management
- Added checks to prevent duplicate subscriptions:
  ```typescript
  // Ensure we don't try to subscribe if already subscribed
  if (subscriptionRegistry.isSubscribed(subscriptionKey)) {
    console.log('Already subscribed to', subscriptionKey);
    return;
  }
  ```

### 2. **Channel Null Error**
**Problem**: `TypeError: channel is null` in cleanup functions

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced subscription registry with better cleanup management
- Added null checks before channel operations
- Improved error handling in cleanup functions
- Added scheduled cleanup with timeout management

### 3. **Foreign Key Constraint Error**
**Problem**: `insert or update on table "contributions" violates foreign key constraint "contributions_member_id_fkey"`

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced member validation in `useContributionForm.ts`
- Added proper member status checking:
  ```typescript
  // Get member data with status validation
  const { data: memberData, error: memberError } = await supabase
    .from('group_members')
    .select('id, status')
    .eq('user_id', user!.id)
    .eq('group_id', formData.selectedGroup)
    .single();

  if (memberData.status !== 'active') {
    throw new Error(`Your membership status is "${memberData.status}". Only active members can record contributions.`);
  }
  ```
- Added better error messages for membership issues

### 4. **Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Warning**
**Problem**: React warning about changing uncontrolled inputs to controlled

**Fixes Applied**:
- Ensured all form inputs have proper default values
- Made sure phone number defaults to empty string consistently
- Added proper initialization in form hooks

### 5. **WebSocket Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Firefox WebSocket connection errors and cookie rejection

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced Supabase client configuration with better realtime settings:
  ```typescript
  realtime: {
    params: {
      eventsPerSecond: 2,
    },
    heartbeatIntervalMs: 30000,
    reconnectDelayMs: 1000,
  }
  ```
- Added graceful connection error handling
- Improved retry logic with exponential backoff

### 6. **Notification Permission Error**
**Problem**: Firefox notification permission request outside user interaction

**Fixes Applied**:
- Modified push notification service to handle permission states properly
- Added conditional permission requests
- Prevented automatic permission requests on app load

### 7. **Error Boundary Implementation**
**Problem**: Component crashes bringing down entire app

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created `ErrorBoundary.tsx` component with proper error handling
- Wrapped main app content with error boundary
- Added development-friendly error display with stack traces
